			Rise above going to start the war
			What you want, what you need,
			What'd you come here for?
			Well, an eye for an eye
			And an 'F' for fight
			They're taking me down as a prisoner's riot

			I've got shackles on, my words are tied
			Fear can make you compromise
			Lights turned up, it's hard to hide
			Sometimes I want to disappear

			When I feel kinda bad and don't want to stress
			I just pass it off, on ability
			Well you got what you want, and what you never knew
			Perfect gift from me to you

			I've got shackles on, my words are tied
			Fear can make you compromise
			With the lights turned up, it's hard to hide
			Sometimes I want to disappear

			-Raise up to your ability-
			You never knew what I could find
			What to come when they realize
			Don't, no one want to compromise

			-Raise up to your ability-
			I'm scared but I'll disappear
			Run around before I'll come with you
			Like he's someone who's lost his way

			-Raise up to your ability-
			I know that you wanna
			Because it's possible to see
			Of my ability

			-Raise up to your ability-
			Yeah you have decided it
			Yeah so I can see you
			Yeah I'm going away to my way

			Focus on your ability
			Focus on your ability
			Now focus on your ability
			Focus on your ability

			Then they cannot get what they want to steal
			Cannot get what they want to steal
			Then they cannot get what they want to steal
			Cannot get what they want to steal
