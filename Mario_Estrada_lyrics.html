			Can you still remember
			When little things made you happy?
			And can you still remember
			When simple things made you smile?

			Life can be so simple,
			If you can only see.
			Whatever happened to those days?
			Whatever happened to those nights?

			Can you still remember
			When little things made you sad?
			And can you still remember
			When simple things made you sad?

			Is it just me or is it just us
			Feeling lost in this world?
			Why do we have to cause this pain?
			Why do we have to weep tears?

			Please tell me we're not alone
			In this world fighting the wind.
			Life can be simple if you can only see
			The best is yet to come.
